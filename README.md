JSE - A Java Search Engine

## Overview
This project will take a set of keywords and search through a list of files with the following search types:

**AND** - Contains all of the keywords, but isn't required to have the keywords in the same order.

**OR** - Contains one or more of the keywords, but isn't required to have the keywords in the same order.

**PHRASE** - Contains all of the keywords, and **is** required to have the keywords in the same order.


It will return that file if it passes the required search types.
